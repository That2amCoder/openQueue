# OpenQueue

OpenQueue is an open source queue managment system to handle queues. Allows anybody with a web browser to enter the queue and fill in customizable parameters, and provides an administrative overview in handling it.

Also it provides a "handler" page, which automatically gathers the next item in the queue and serves it in order to manage it better.

## Features

- Administrative overview, allowing to track who has what ticket and manage tickets back and forth in terms of state
- Handler page, allowing for handlers to see the current ticket at hand and change the status
- A queue system, which allows users to enter their information with user-specified questions
- A public board page for people to easily know how to join the queue with a QR code
- Also the user knows how far they are in the queue

## Planned features:
- Statistics, such as number of handlers, average response rate
- Better customization and optimization. Such as being able to edit forms.
- Live handler statistics (location, workload etc)
